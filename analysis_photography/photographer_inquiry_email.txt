Subject: Photography Inquiry - Intimate 20-Guest Family Celebration (Elopement/Micro-Wedding Package?)

Hi [Photographer Name],

I'm reaching out to inquire about photography for an intimate family celebration we're planning in Boston. Since this is a small gathering (20 guests) rather than a traditional wedding, I'm hoping your elopement or micro-wedding packages might be a perfect fit!

EVENT DETAILS:
• Date: Monday, February 23, 2026
• Time: 2:30 PM - 7 PM (4.5 hours coverage)
• Guest Count: 20 people (intimate elopement)
• Event Type: Elopement ceremony at Boston Public Library + celebration dinner

LOCATIONS (All within Back Bay - 0.5 mile radius):
1. **The Lenox Hotel** (2:30-3:15 PM) - "First look" portraits before ceremony (45 min)
2. **Boston Public Library** (3:30-5:15 PM) - Elopement ceremony (prompt at 3:30 PM) + formal family portraits - outdoor courtyard & interior ⭐ **PRIORITY**
3. **The Banks Seafood and Steak** (5:30-7:00 PM) - Candid reception dinner photos (1.5 hours)

WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR:
• The Boston Public Library is THE most important element - elopement ceremony INSIDE the library at 3:30 PM sharp, plus formal family portraits
• First look portraits at Lenox Hotel one hour before ceremony
• Candid dinner moments at our intimate reception
• Natural, warm editing style (not overly dramatic)
• Digital files with print rights

PRICING QUESTION - KEY:
Since this is an intimate elopement ceremony at BPL (3:30 PM) with extended coverage:
• **Do you offer elopement or micro-wedding pricing?**
• **What would pricing look like for 4.5 hours across these three locations?**
• **Could an elopement package with extended coverage work for our needs?**

OTHER QUESTIONS:
1. Are you available on Monday, February 23, 2026?
2. **Do you have experience shooting at the Boston Public Library? (This is VERY important to us!)**
3. **Can you photograph the ceremony INSIDE the Boston Public Library?** (We're eloping inside at 3:30 PM)
4. Have you photographed at The Banks or similar Boston restaurant venues?
5. What's included in your package?
   - Number of edited images delivered
   - Turnaround time
   - Online gallery access
   - Digital rights
5. Do you charge travel fees for multiple locations in the same area?
6. Can we see a full gallery from a similar intimate event or BPL shoot?
7. Do you have liability insurance? (May be needed for BPL)
8. Are you familiar with any restrictions for photographing ceremonies inside BPL?
9. What's your backup plan if you're unable to shoot?
10. Do you offer payment plans?

ABOUT US:
We're having an intimate elopement ceremony at 3:30 PM INSIDE the Boston Public Library, with first look photos at the Lenox Hotel one hour before, followed by a celebration dinner at The Banks. The BPL ceremony is the heart of our celebration (a meaningful location for our family), and we want to capture both the ceremony itself and formal family portraits in that beautiful space, plus the warmth of our intimate dinner. We're looking for a photographer who can handle an indoor ceremony, formal portraits, and natural candid moments.

The three locations are all within a 5-10 minute walk of each other in Back Bay, making transitions very easy.

Given this is an elopement with 20 guests (not a large traditional wedding), I'm hoping we can find elopement-style pricing that works for both of us!

I'd love to schedule a call to discuss your availability and packages.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

ALTERNATE VERSION - SHORTER

Subject: Inquiry - Elopement/Micro-Wedding Package for 20-Guest Celebration?

Hi [Photographer Name],

I'm planning an intimate 20-guest elopement in Boston on Monday, February 23, 2026 and wondering if your elopement or micro-wedding packages might work for us!

Quick overview:
• Date: Monday, February 23, 2026
• 4.5 hours (2:30-7 PM)
• 3 locations in Back Bay: Lenox Hotel (first look portraits), Boston Public Library (elopement ceremony INSIDE at 3:30 PM sharp + family portraits ⭐ priority), The Banks (dinner)
• 20 guests - intimate elopement + family celebration
• First look coverage + ceremony inside BPL + formal portraits + candid dinner moments

Since this is an elopement (ceremony at BPL) with extended coverage, I'm hoping elopement pricing might apply?

Key question: **Do you have Boston Public Library experience?** (This is our main priority!)

What would elopement/micro-wedding pricing look like for this?

Would love to see your BPL portfolio work!

Best,
[Your Name]
