Subject: Photography Inquiry - Elopement at BPL Guastavino Room (2-3 hour options)

Hi [Photographer Name],

I'm reaching out to inquire about photography for an intimate elopement ceremony we're planning at the Boston Public Library's Guastavino Room. Since this is a small ceremony (20 guests), I'm hoping your elopement or micro-wedding packages might be a perfect fit!

EVENT DETAILS:
• Date: Monday, February 23, 2026
• Time Options: 2-3 hour coverage (see options below)
• Guest Count: 20 people (intimate elopement)
• Event Type: Elopement ceremony in BPL Guastavino Room + family portraits

CEREMONY LOCATION:
• **Boston Public Library - Guastavino Room** (BPL's designated elopement room)
• **Ceremony: 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM sharp**
• Interior access: Guastavino Room only (no access to Bates Hall or other BPL areas)
• Exterior access: Grand entrance staircase, facade, courtyard fountain

COVERAGE OPTIONS I'M CONSIDERING:

**Option 1: 2-Hour Coverage** (Budget-friendly)
• 2:30-3:30 PM: Pre-ceremony arrival, setup shots, guest arrivals
• 3:30-4:30 PM: Full ceremony coverage in Guastavino Room + quick family portraits
• Location: BPL Guastavino Room only

**Option 2: 3-Hour Coverage** (Preferred)
• 2:30-3:30 PM: Pre-ceremony portraits and setup
• 3:30-4:30 PM: Full ceremony coverage in Guastavino Room
• 4:30-5:30 PM: Extended family portraits on BPL exterior (grand staircase, facade, courtyard)
• Location: BPL Guastavino Room + BPL exterior grounds

WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR:
• The ceremony in Guastavino Room is THE most important element
• Extended time for family portraits on BPL's iconic exterior grand staircase
• Natural, warm editing style (not overly dramatic)
• Digital files with print rights

PRICING QUESTIONS - KEY:
• **Do you offer elopement or micro-wedding pricing?**
• **What would pricing look like for 2 hours vs 3 hours at BPL?**
• **Have you photographed ceremonies in BPL's Guastavino Room before?**
• **Do you have experience with BPL exterior portraits (grand entrance staircase)?**

OTHER QUESTIONS:
1. Are you available on Monday, February 23, 2026?
2. **Do you have experience shooting at the Boston Public Library? (Very important!)**
3. **Have you shot in the Guastavino Room specifically?**
4. What's included in your package?
   - Number of edited images delivered
   - Turnaround time
   - Online gallery access
   - Digital rights
5. Can we see a full gallery from a BPL ceremony or intimate elopement?
6. Do you have liability insurance? (Required by BPL)
7. What's your backup plan if you're unable to shoot?
8. Do you offer payment plans?

ABOUT US:
We're having an intimate elopement ceremony at 3:30 PM in the Boston Public Library's Guastavino Room. The BPL location is very meaningful to our family, and we want to capture both the ceremony and beautiful family portraits on the iconic exterior staircase and grounds. We're looking for a photographer who specializes in intimate ceremonies and can work efficiently with our 20-guest elopement.

Given the small guest count and focused 2-3 hour timeline, I'm hoping we can find elopement-style pricing that works for both of us!

I'd love to schedule a call to discuss your availability and packages.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
