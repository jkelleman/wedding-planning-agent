## Key Findings

1. **The Banks Seafood** offers the most flexibility with 7 different price tiers from $45-145pp
2. All venues from Chef Robert Sisca's team (The Banks, Bistro du Midi, CLINK) have confirmed accurate pricing
3. **21 total options** are within your $5,000 budget
4. Actual per-person meal costs range from $45-160 (not the $500+ initially extracted by automated scanner)
5. The scanner was extracting room minimums, rental fees, and package totals instead of per-person meal pricing

## Technical Notes

The initial price extraction issue was resolved by manually reviewing PDF files to find context-aware pricing (looking for "per person", "pp", "per guest" near price mentions). Future scanner improvements should implement this context-aware extraction logic.
