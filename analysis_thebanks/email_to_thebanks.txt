Subject: Fireplace Room Inquiry - Follow-up Questions (20 guests)

Hi [Contact Name],

Thank you so much for sending over the private dining packet and beverage list! I'm very excited about the Fireplace Room for our celebration.

I've reviewed the menus carefully and have selected the following for 20 guests (including 2 guests with celiac disease who require strictly gluten-free options):

Tier 2 Dinner Menu ($115/person + $15/person for 2 sides = $130/person × 20 guests = $2,600)
- Appetizers: Lobster Bisque, Chopped Salad, Steamed Mussels
- Entrées: 14oz Ribeye, Salmon, Tuna, Roasted Chicken  
- Sides (family-style): Potato Purée, Sautéed Mushrooms
- Desserts: Crème Brûlée, Ice Cream/Sorbet, Cheesecake

Cocktail Hour - Hors d'Oeuvres (Total: $477):
- Tuna Tartare: 12 pieces × $6/piece = $72
- Bacon Wrapped Scallops: 15 pieces × $10/piece = $150
- Crab Cake Sliders: 12 pieces × $10/piece = $120
- Classic Margherita Flatbread: 3 pizzas × $21/pizza = $63
- Chicken Skewers: 12 pieces × $6/piece = $72

Beverages (Total: $860):
- Wine: 3 bottles Malbec ($56 × 3 = $168) + 3 bottles Routestock Chardonnay ($64 × 3 = $192) = $360
- Standard tier cocktails: ~20 drinks × $25/drink = $500

Important notes: 
- Not all guests will be drinking alcohol due to religious beliefs, personal preference, health reasons, and age. We anticipate roughly half the group (about 10-12 guests) will consume alcohol, which is why we're planning for modest wine and cocktail quantities.
- 2 guests have celiac disease and require strictly gluten-free meals (no cross-contamination). This affects appetizers, entrées, sides, hors d'oeuvres, and desserts.

Before I move forward, I have a few questions:

Menu & Dietary Accommodations:
1. Can you confirm which menu items are naturally gluten-free or can be prepared gluten-free for our 2 celiac guests?
2. For hors d'oeuvres, which items are safe for celiac guests? (I'm assuming crab cake sliders and flatbread contain gluten)
3. What gluten-free dessert options are available as substitutes?
4. How does your kitchen handle gluten-free preparation to avoid cross-contamination?
5. How many slices/pieces does each Margherita Flatbread yield?
6. The sides are listed as family-style—does that mean shared platters for the table?
7. Is bread service included during dinner? (Can we skip this or have GF bread available?)
8. Do you accommodate other dietary restrictions? We also have 1 guest with a tree nut allergy (no tree nuts or cross-contamination, please).

Beverages:
9. What non-alcoholic beverage options are included? (This is important since many guests won't be drinking alcohol)
10. Are there mocktail options or special non-alcoholic drinks available?
11. For the cocktails, will the bartender track consumption to stay within our ~$500 budget?
12. Can we adjust wine quantities closer to the event date based on final RSVPs?

Timing & Logistics:
13. Does the cocktail hour count toward total event time or is it additional?
14. What's the total event duration you recommend for this menu?
15. How many servers will be assigned for 20 guests?

Fees & Policies:
16. Can you confirm the admin fee is 7%? 
17. Is the 7% tax applied to both food and beverages?
18. When would final payment and guest count be due?
19. What's your cancellation/postponement policy?

Next Steps:
20. Can we schedule a tasting before the event?
21. Is there availability for a site visit to see the Fireplace Room setup?

My estimated total comes to $5,275 for 20 guests ($2,600 dinner + $477 hors d'oeuvres + $860 beverages = $3,937 subtotal, plus 20% gratuity, 7% admin fee, and 7% tax). The Fireplace Room looks perfect for our celebration, and I'm hoping to move forward soon!

Looking forward to hearing from you.
