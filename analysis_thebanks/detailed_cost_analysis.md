## 💡 Cost-Saving Opportunities

### 1. Reduce Cocktail Count

- Risk: May run out during cocktail hour

### 2. Standard vs Premium Spirits
**Potential savings: $0-100** (depends on venue pricing)

### Confirming Details with The Banks

**Questions to Ask:**

2. Are sides included, or is this truly an add-on?
3. Can we see the current seasonal menu options?
4. How many entrée choices are provided in Tier 2?
5. Are appetizers or salads included?
6. What about dessert?

### Potential Menu Structure

**Tier 2 might include:**

- Choice of 3-4 entrées:
  - Seafood option (salmon, halibut, sea bass)
  - Steak option (NY strip, filet)
  - Chicken or alternative
  - Vegetarian option
- Chef's accompaniments
- Dessert

**The $15/person sides:**
