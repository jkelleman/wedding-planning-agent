##  Creating Custom Skills

Extend the agent by creating your own skills! Here's how:

### 1. Create a new file in `src/skills/`

```python
# src/skills/my_custom_skill.py
from typing import Dict, Any
from .base_skill import BaseSkill

class MyCustomSkill(BaseSkill):
    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "my_custom_skill"
    
    @property
    def description(self) -> str:
        return "Does something awesome for wedding planning"
    
    @property
    def version(self) -> str:
        return "1.0.0"
    
    @property
    def category(self) -> str:
        return "planning"  # or "analysis", "communication", "financial", etc.
    
    def execute(self, **kwargs) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Your skill logic here
        return {
            'status': 'success',
            'result': {
                'message': 'Skill executed successfully!'
            }
        }
```

### 2. The skill is automatically discovered!

Budget Allocation: $10,000.00
Over Budget: Yes
Negotiation Potential: HIGH - Significantly above market rate

Suggested Counter-Offer: $10,000.00
  Reduction: $2,500.00 (20.0%)
  Rationale: aligns with our $10,000 budget allocation, brings price closer to market average ($8,500)

Market Comparison:
  Market Average: $8,500.00
  This Quote: above average
  Difference: +$4,000.00 (+47.1%)

Top Negotiation Strategies:
  1. Emphasize budget constraints ($10,000 allocated for catering)
  2. Reference market rates (average: $8,500)
  3. Consider reducing guest count or simplifying menu options
  4. Offer to book multiple services together for a discount

**Generated Email**:
```
Subject: Re: Catering Quote - Following Up

Dear Bistro Catering Services Team,

Thank you for providing your detailed quote for our wedding catering. We were impressed with your offerings and the quality of service you provide.

After carefully reviewing our overall wedding budget and comparing various options, we would like to discuss the pricing. Your quoted amount of $12,500.00 is slightly above our allocated budget for this category.

We would like to propose a revised price of $10,000.00, which represents a 20.0% adjustment. This aligns with our $10,000 budget allocation, brings price closer to market average ($8,500).

We are very interested in working with you and believe this pricing would allow us to move forward confidently. We are flexible on certain details and would be happy to discuss how we can make this work for both parties.

Would you be available for a brief call this week to discuss this further? We are hoping to finalize our vendor selections soon and would love to include you in our plans.

Thank you for your consideration, and we look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```
