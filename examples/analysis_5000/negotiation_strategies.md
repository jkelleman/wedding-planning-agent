Subject: Custom Menu Pricing for Wedding Reception

Hi [Contact Name]!

We absolutely loved [venue name] during our visit! Your space is beautiful and we can really picture our celebration there.

I wanted to reach out about potentially customizing the [Tier Name] package. We're working with a $[budget] budget for 25 guests, and the $[X]pp pricing is just a bit above what we can do.

Here's a thought: What if we simplified the menu to [number] entree choices instead of [number]? I know this would make things easier for your kitchen, and honestly, we'd rather have fewer amazing options than compromise on quality!

Would something around $[target]pp work for a streamlined menu? We're totally flexible on which dishes - we trust your team to pick what works best!

Let me know what you think! We're hoping to make a decision soon and would love to celebrate with you.

Thanks so much!

### Firm (But Polite) Template

Subject: Budget-Conscious Menu Proposal

Dear [Venue Name] Team,

We are considering [venue name] for our wedding reception on [date] with 25 guests. Your [Tier Name] package at $[X] per person exceeds our budget of $[max budget]pp.

To meet our budget while still working with your venue, we propose:
- [Number] entree selections (instead of [number])
- Pricing adjusted to $[target] per person
- Total event cost: $[total] (base) + gratuity/tax

This streamlined approach reduces operational complexity while maintaining quality. We need to make our venue decision by [date] and are evaluating several options within our budget range.

Please advise if this pricing structure is feasible. If not, we'll need to proceed with alternative venues.

Thank you for your prompt response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

##  Negotiation Tips & Best Practices

### When to Negotiate
✅ **After receiving initial quote**
✅ **Before signing contract**
✅ **When comparing multiple venues**
✅ **During slower booking seasons** (January-March, November)

❌ **Don't negotiate:**
- After signing contract
- During peak wedding season (May-October)
- For dates less than 6 months away

---

### Why Reducing Options Works

**From Venue's Perspective:**
1. **Inventory Management:** Fewer ingredients to order and manage
2. **Kitchen Efficiency:** Streamlined prep reduces labor costs
3. **Food Waste:** Less risk of preparing dishes that aren't selected
4. **Service Speed:** Faster plating and coordination
5. **Quality Control:** Easier to perfect fewer dishes

**From Your Perspective:**
1. **Lower cost** without sacrificing quality
2. **Simplified guest choices** (paradox of choice)
3. **Faster service** on event day
4. **Still provides variety** for dietary needs

---

### Expected Outcomes

**Realistic Expectations:**
- **5-10% discount:** Most likely scenario
- **10-15% discount:** Possible with good negotiation and timing
- **15%+ discount:** Rare, usually only in off-season

**Alternative Value-Adds:**
If they won't reduce base price, ask for:
- Complimentary champagne toast
- Upgraded dessert option
- Extended cocktail hour
- Waived room fee or cake cutting fee
- Wine pairings included

---

### Conversation Starters

**In-Person/Phone:**
- "We love your venue! Is there flexibility on pricing if we simplify the menu?"
- "What if we reduced the entree choices - could that affect the per-person cost?"
- "We're comparing several options. Can you work with us on customizing a package?"
- "Is there a tier between [X] and [Y] that offers fewer selections?"

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
❌ "Your competitor offers this cheaper"
❌ "This seems really expensive"
❌ Demanding or entitled tone
❌ Threatening to go elsewhere (unless true)
