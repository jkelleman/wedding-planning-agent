##  Photography Priorities & Style Preferences

## ⏰ Timeline Management Tips

### For Photographer:
1. **Arrive 15 minutes early** to scout Guastavino Room and plan shots
2. **Ceremony is PROMPT at 3:30 PM** - be ready and in position
3. **Work efficiently during portraits** - February daylight is limited
4. **Communicate clearly** about family groupings to save time
5. **Have backup plan** for weather (portraits in Guastavino Room if needed)

### Family Coordination:
- Designate a family member to help gather people for group shots
- Have list of priority family groupings ready

- Consider doing largest groups first, then smaller groupings

### Weather Considerations:
