##  Music Selection Tips

### Choosing Ceremony Music
1. **Personal meaning matters most** - Don't pick a song just because it's "traditional"
2. **Consider the moment** - Processional should match the emotion you want
3. **Check with officiant** - Some religious venues have music restrictions
4. **Think about tempo** - Practice walking to the song to ensure timing works
5. **Have backup** - Bring music on multiple devices/formats

### Creating Playlists
1. **Length matters** - Create playlists 20-30% longer than needed (for delays)
2. **Flow is important** - Start mellow, build energy, then wind down
3. **Mix eras** - Something for every generation of guests
4. **Test volume levels** - Dinner music should be softer than dancing music
5. **Avoid explicit lyrics** - Especially if you have diverse/older guests or kids

### Working with a DJ
1. **Be specific** - Provide must-play and do-not-play lists
2. **Trust their expertise** - They read rooms for a living
3. **Provide context** - Explain your guest demographics and preferences
4. **Meet beforehand** - Discuss your vision and vibe
5. **Share timeline** - They need to know when to play what

### Working with Live Musicians
1. **Request song list** - See their repertoire
2. **Ask about special requests** - Can they learn your song?
3. **Discuss volume** - Especially for dinner music
4. **Clarify breaks** - When do they rest? Background music needed?
5. **Provide detailed timeline** - They need to know when to play

### DIY Playlist Considerations
1. **Designate a manager** - Someone to press play, adjust volume, handle transitions
2. **Download everything** - Don't rely on WiFi/cell service
3. **Test the venue's system** - Visit beforehand to test
4. **Create seamless transitions** - Use crossfade feature on Spotify
5. **Have backup device** - Phone, tablet, laptop - all with the same playlists
6. **Charge everything** - And bring chargers
7. **Consider hiring sound tech** - Even for DIY, they can manage logistics
