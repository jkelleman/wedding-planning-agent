### Research Phase
1. **Cast a wide net** - Contact 5-10 vendors initially
2. **Use multiple sources** - Google, social media, The Knot, WeddingWire, local wedding groups
3. **Look beyond price** - Cheapest isn't always best value
4. **Check recent work** - Styles and quality can evolve
5. **Read full reviews** - Not just star ratings

### Evaluation Phase
1. **Create consistent criteria** - Use same questions for all vendors
2. **Take good notes** - Easy to forget details after meeting multiple vendors
3. **Trust your gut** - Personality fit matters
4. **Consider communication** - How quickly/professionally do they respond?
5. **Look for red flags** - Pushy sales tactics, vague answers, inconsistent information

### Decision Phase
1. **Sleep on it** - Don't book immediately after consultation
2. **Compare total costs** - Not just base package prices
3. **Reread contracts carefully** - Understand what you're committing to
4. **Negotiate when appropriate** - Many vendors have flexibility
5. **Book with confidence** - Once decided, don't second-guess
