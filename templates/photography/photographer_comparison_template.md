##  Photography Selection Tips

### Research Phase
1. **Start early** - Book 6-12 months out for popular photographers
2. **Look beyond price** - Cheapest isn't always best value
3. **Review FULL weddings** - Don't just look at highlight reels
4. **Check recent work** - Style and quality should be consistent
5. **Read reviews** - Look for professionalism, communication, delivery

### Consultation Phase
1. **Meet before booking** - Video call or in-person
2. **Ask to see full wedding gallery** - Not just highlights
3. **Discuss your vision** - Make sure they understand
4. **Review contract carefully** - Understand cancellation, delivery, rights
5. **Trust your gut** - Personal connection matters

### Questions to Ask
- How many weddings have you photographed?
- Do you have backup equipment?
- What happens if you're sick on my wedding day?
- When will I receive my photos?
- How many edited images should I expect?
- Do I get high-resolution files?
- Can I print the photos myself?
- Do you shoot RAW? Will I receive RAW files?
- What's your editing style?
- Have you shot at my venue before?
- Do you have liability insurance?
- What's your payment schedule?
- What's your cancellation/refund policy?

-  No reviews or references
-  Unwilling to show full wedding galleries
