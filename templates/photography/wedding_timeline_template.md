##  Photography Timeline Tips

### Before Creating Your Timeline:
1. **Know your priorities** - What moments matter most?
2. **Consider the light** - Plan outdoor shots during golden hour
3. **Factor in travel time** - Between ceremony/reception/photo locations
4. **Consult your photographer** - They know how long things actually take
5. **Be realistic** - Don't cram too much into too little time

### Creating the Timeline:
1. **Start with fixed times** - Ceremony, sunset, venue access
2. **Work backwards** - When do you need to be ready?
3. **Build in buffer time** - Things always take longer than expected
4. **Prioritize family photos** - These can be time-consuming
5. **Plan for golden hour** - If you want those warm, glowing photos

### Sharing with Your Photographer:
- Send timeline 2-4 weeks before wedding
- Include addresses and parking for all locations
- Note any special moments or traditions
- Share family photo list with names
- Designate point person for wrangling family members
- Be open to their suggestions for timing adjustments

### Day-of Execution:
- Stick to timeline as much as possible
- Empower point person to keep things moving
- Trust your photographer's direction during portraits
- Don't stress if running 10-15 min behind
- Focus on moments, not just photos
