## 💡 Tips for Using Templates

**Keep originals clean:**
- Never edit the template files directly
- Always copy first, then customize
- This way templates stay blank for reuse

**Customize freely:**
- Templates are starting points, not rules
- Add sections that matter to you
- Delete sections you don't need
- Make it work for your wedding style

**Create your own:**
- If you create a useful document during planning
- Save a blank "template" version
- Add it to the appropriate folder here
- Help future brides!
